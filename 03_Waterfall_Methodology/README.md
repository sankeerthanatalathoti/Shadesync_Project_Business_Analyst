# ðŸ’§ ShadeSync â€” Waterfall Methodology

This folder contains the **Waterfall Model Documentation** for the *ShadeSync Project*, representing the sequential, phase-driven approach to business and system documentation.  
It includes all key artifacts prepared as part of the traditional SDLC process â€” from high-level business understanding to detailed system functionality.

---

## ðŸ“˜ Overview

The **Waterfall methodology** was adopted to document the *ShadeSync Project* from a structured, requirement-first perspective.  
This section demonstrates the complete lifecycle flow â€” covering **Business Requirements**, **Functional Design**, and **Project Overview** â€” developed in clearly defined stages ensuring traceability and business alignment.

The approach ensures that each phase (Requirement â†’ Design â†’ Development â†’ Testing â†’ Deployment) is **well-documented, reviewed, and approved** before proceeding to the next, maintaining clarity and minimizing rework.
